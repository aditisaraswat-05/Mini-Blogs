# Mini-Blogs
This project is a Mini Blog Web App that fetches and displays blog posts from an external API. It includes search functionality and reaction counts (likes/dislikes/views). 
**How It Works (User Experience)**
The page loads and fetches blog posts from dummyjson.com.

Posts are displayed in a grid layout with titles, descriptions, tags, and reaction counts.

Users can search for posts using the search bar.

The page dynamically updates the post list based on the search query.
